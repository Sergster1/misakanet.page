# Misaka 10032: The best Waifu. Ever.

This is a website for those who wanna praise Misaka 10032, you can actually browse it at <https://misakanet.page>

This repo is for the people interested in the code

## Special Thanks to
  * Pizzacus for the original idea and for helping me with the JS for the Music Visualizer Easter Egg

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Sergster1/misakanet.page.git # If you work with HTTPS
git clone git@github.com:Sergster1/misakanet.page.git # If you work with SSH

# Install the dependencies
npm install   # For NPM users
yarn install  # For Yarn men of culture

# You can build a static version of the website, all the files go into `dist/`
npm run build # On NPM or
yarn build    # On Yarn

# You can also run a development server that automatically reloads when you change anything!
npm run serve # On NPM or
yarn serve    # On yarn

# Finally, use --production to create an optimised build
# that is smaller and more compatible, but takes way more time to generate
npm run build --production # On NPM or
yarn build --production    # On Yarn

# (also works with `serve`)
```
## Translating

* Go to <https://misakanet.page/#translator-mode>, new buttons will appear on the top-left
* Click on "Download" to get a copy of every string of text on the website
* Use an IDE such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to edit the YAML file
* Use the "Browse..." button on misakanet.page in translator mode to load your YAML file on the website to preview your changes locally
* Once you're done, send your translation to **Sergster1#0032** on Discord, or to **/u/Sergster1** on Reddit
* Or, if you know how to use GitHub (this step is optional), fork this project to your account, clone it to your computer,
convert the YAML to JSON and add it to /src/locales and add the option for it in the index.html file around line 128, then you can do a pull request
